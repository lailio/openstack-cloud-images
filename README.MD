# **OpenStack Glance OS Image Collection Deployed with Terraform**

## **Overview**

This repository provides a Terraform configuration for deploying and managing OS images in **OpenStack Glance**. Using this setup, you can automate the process of importing and managing a collection of operating system images, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments.

## **Prerequisites**

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

1. A **working OpenStack cluster** with API access enabled.
2. **Terraform** installed on your system.
   - [Installation guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
3. OpenStack **credentials set as environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export OS_AUTH_URL=<your-auth-url>
   export OS_USERNAME=<your-username>
   export OS_PASSWORD=<your-password>
   export OS_PROJECT_NAME=<your-project-name>
   export OS_REGION_NAME=<your-region-name>
   ```
4. Ensure your OpenStack user has permissions to manage Glance images.
5. OpenStack CLI installed (optional for testing).

## **Deployment Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### **2. Initialize Terraform**

Run the following command to initialize the Terraform working directory:
```bash
terraform init
```
This will download the necessary provider plugins and prepare the directory for use.

### **3. Modify Configuration (Optional)**

If needed, customize the variables in `variables.tf` or create a `terraform.tfvars` file to provide values for the required parameters, such as image URLs, names, or descriptions.

Example `terraform.tfvars`:
```hcl
default_image_format = "qcow2"
glance_images = {
  "Ubuntu_22_04" = {
    url         = "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/jammy/release/ubuntu-22.04.qcow2"
    container_format = "bare"
    disk_format = "qcow2"
    visibility  = "public"
  },
  "CentOS_8_Stream" = {
    url         = "https://cloud.centos.org/centos/8-stream/x86_64/images/CentOS-Stream-GenericCloud-8.qcow2"
    container_format = "bare"
    disk_format = "qcow2"
    visibility  = "private"
  }
}
```

### **4. Apply the Configuration**

Run the following command to apply the changes and create the Glance images:
```bash
terraform apply
```
Terraform will prompt for confirmation. Type `yes` to proceed.

### **5. Verify the Deployment**

To ensure the images have been successfully imported:
- **Via OpenStack CLI**:
  ```bash
  openstack image list
  ```
- **Via OpenStack Horizon Dashboard**:
  Navigate to the *Compute* > *Images* section.

## **Configuration Files**

- `main.tf`: Defines the OpenStack Glance provider and image resource configurations.
- `variables.tf`: Contains variable declarations for user-defined configurations.
- `terraform.tfvars` (optional): Provides default values for variables (e.g., image URLs).
- `outputs.tf`: Displays outputs such as the image names and IDs upon successful deployment.

---

## **Example Configuration**

Here’s an example of how to define Glance images in `main.tf`:

```hcl
resource "openstack_images_image_v2" "os_images" {
  for_each = var.glance_images

  name             = each.key
  image_source_url = each.value.url
  container_format = each.value.container_format
  disk_format      = each.value.disk_format
  visibility       = each.value.visibility
}
```

---

## **Variable Descriptions**

- `glance_images`: A map of image names to their properties.
  - `url`: The URL of the OS image to download.
  - `container_format`: Format of the container (`bare` for most cloud images).
  - `disk_format`: Disk image format (`qcow2`, `raw`, etc.).
  - `visibility`: Controls who can access the image (`public`, `private`).

## **Commands Reference**

| **Command**             | **Description**                                         |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `terraform init`        | Initializes the working directory.                      |
| `terraform plan`        | Shows a preview of the changes Terraform will make.     |
| `terraform apply`       | Applies the configuration and creates resources.        |
| `terraform destroy`     | Destroys all resources managed by Terraform.             |

---

## **Updating or Destroying Resources**

To **update** the images (for example, change visibility or image version), modify the `terraform.tfvars` file and re-run:
```bash
terraform apply
```

To **destroy** all Glance images created by this Terraform configuration:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- **Issue:** OpenStack API authentication failure.
  - **Solution:** Verify that your environment variables are correctly set and the values match your OpenStack project credentials.

- **Issue:** Timeout when uploading large images.
  - **Solution:** Check your OpenStack Glance API settings and increase the allowed timeout or image size limits.

- **Issue:** Image format errors.
  - **Solution:** Ensure that the disk format (`qcow2`, `raw`, etc.) matches the format specified in the image URL.
